## Sweden’s new citizenship test: what is happening?

The Swedish government plans to introduce a **citizenship test** that all applicants must pass. The test will include basic Swedish language skills and knowledge of Swedish society.

But the universities responsible for creating the test say the timeline is not realistic. They warn that the work is complex, the deadlines are too short, and the legal framework is not even finished. This has now caused major delays.

## A politically popular idea

“There is a broad political agreement that a citizenship test is the right way forward,” says Minister of Higher Education Lotta Edholm.

The idea is not new. It was first proposed more than 20 years ago and returned in the January Agreement. Today, the current government and the Sweden Democrats all support it. They argue that the test will strengthen integration and encourage people to finish Swedish studies such as SFI.

## Who is responsible for the test?

The government has given three bodies the main responsibility:

- **UHR (Universitets- och högskolerådet)** — runs the tests in practice  
- **Stockholm University** — creates the Swedish language test  
- **Gothenburg University** — creates the civics test  

But both universities have protested.  
Stockholm University says that creating citizenship exams is not part of their academic mission.  
The government’s response has been that universities are state authorities and must follow orders.

## The timeline is breaking down

UHR has now told the government that the test will **not** be ready by the official deadline of **17 August 2026**.

According to UHR:

- The **Swedish language test** cannot be ready until **autumn 2028 at the earliest**.  
- The **civics test** can only be delivered as prototype questions in 2026.  
- There is still **no final law** or proposition, which makes planning extremely difficult.  
- The test must be trialled on different groups, and the testing locations must be accessible for everyone.

“It is a complicated process to develop a citizenship test,” says UHR’s Susanne Wadsborn-Taube.

## Why the government still wants the test quickly

Lotta Edholm says the test is important for integration. She argues that many people struggle to get a job because their Swedish is not strong enough. A citizenship test can work as motivation to complete SFI, where many students drop out today.

The government sees the test as both a requirement and a tool to help people improve their Swedish.

## Why universities are protesting

Universities point to three main problems:

1. **The timeline is impossible.** High-quality national tests take years to develop.  
2. **The law is not ready.** Without final rules, no one knows what the test must look like.  
3. **The assignment is political.** Many academics believe that universities should not design political requirement tests.

Because of this, the institutions responsible for building the test say they cannot follow the government’s schedule.

## What happens next?

UHR is waiting for the government’s response. The ministry must now decide whether to move the deadlines, change the assignment, or push ahead despite the warnings.

One thing is clear: the original plan to launch the first parts of the test in 2026 is no longer possible.

The citizenship test will still come — all major political parties support it.  
But when it will be introduced, and what it will look like, is now uncertain.
