## Migrationsverket and Work Permits

Migrationsverket is the authority responsible for processing, approving, or rejecting applications. For applicants waiting months without response, the protections explained in [the four-week rule](/blog/the-four-week-rule) become important.  

### Employer Requirements
Employers must advertise the job within the EU/EEA for at least ten days before offering it to a non-EU applicant. They must also guarantee proper employment terms. These safeguards ensure fair competition and protect workers from exploitation.

### Application Process
Applying for a work permit is typically done online. The applicant needs a job offer, passport, proof of insurance, and in some cases educational documents. Fees are paid with the application, and decisions can take months depending on demand.

### Extensions and Changes
Work permits are often granted for two years at a time. If you wish to change employer or role, you must apply for a new permit. After four years of legal work, you may be eligible for permanent residence.

## Challenges Applicants when applying for work permits
Long waiting times, missing documents, or unclear requirements are common issues. Many applicants turn to legal advisors or unions for support in navigating the process.

### Work Permits and Family Members
In many cases, spouses and children can apply for residence permits linked to the main applicant’s work permit. This allows families to live together in Sweden during the employment period.

## Looking Ahead
With labor shortages in several sectors, Sweden continues to balance attracting skilled workers with maintaining strict application standards. Migrationsverket plays a central role in ensuring this balance.For official details on application fees and timelines, see [Migrationsverket’s website](https://www.migrationsverket.se).
