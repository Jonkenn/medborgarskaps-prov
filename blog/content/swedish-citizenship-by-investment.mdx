# Swedish Citizenship by Investment: updated for 2025/2026

The phrase **“Swedish citizenship by investment”** is one of the most searched immigration topics in Asian. Entrepreneurs, investors, and international families often assume Sweden offers something similar to Malta, Turkey, or the Caribbean citizenship-by-investment (CBI) programs.

Here is the truth in one line:

**Sweden does not offer citizenship by investment, a golden visa, or any program where money speeds up naturalisation.**

What Sweden *does* offer are legitimate **business-based residence permits** that—after years of real residence—*may* lead to citizenship under the same rules as everyone else.

This guide explains exactly what exists, what does not, and how Sweden compares to real CBI countries.

## What “Swedish Citizenship by Investment” Really Means

The term itself is misleading. In Sweden, you cannot buy:

- a passport  
- a residence permit  
- a visa through investment  
- special immigration rights  
- faster citizenship processing  

However, people often use the phrase to mean something else:

**Moving to Sweden through a business residence permit, living long-term, and eventually applying for citizenship.**

The investment itself has **zero legal impact** on the citizenship timeline.

---

## Does Sweden Offer Direct Citizenship by Investment?

**No. Sweden prohibits all forms of investor passports or golden citizenship routes.**

Citizenship applicants—investors included—must meet the same criteria:

- verified identity  
- long-term residence (usually 5 years)  
- clean criminal record  
- stable income and tax compliance  

There are no exceptions for wealthy individuals or entrepreneurs.

## Business Routes That People Confuse With “Investment Visas”

Sweden has **no investment visa**, but it does have **business-based residence permits**.

These permits require *operational work*, not passive investment.

---

## 1. Self-Employed Residence Permit

The main route for entrepreneurs.

Requirements:

- documented experience  
- viable business plan  
- ability to support yourself  
- active, hands-on involvement  
- realistic profitability  

Passive investors do **not** qualify.

---

## 2. Starting a New Business (Startup Activity)

A version of the self-employed permit used by founders.

Applicants must show:

- relevant industry knowledge  
- an innovative or competitive concept  
- a clear market strategy  
- sufficient operational funds  

Capital is reviewed only to check viability—not to offer privileges.

---

## 3. Buying an Existing Company

Some newcomers buy a Swedish company, but this does **not** provide any special residence rights.

To receive a residence permit, you must:

- run the business yourself  
- show realistic revenue plans  
- have the skills to operate it  

Ownership alone is not enough.

---

## The Real Path to Citizenship for Business Owners

If you move to Sweden through business activity, the long-term citizenship route works like this:

### 1. Secure a Business-Based Residence Permit  
Self-employed, startup, or hands-on company ownership.

### 2. Live in Sweden Long Enough  
Usually **5 years** of legal, continuous residence.

### 3. Maintain Clean Conduct  
No serious crime, no tax debts, consistent income.

### 4. Apply for Swedish Citizenship  
Processed under standard rules—no investor advantages.

## Financial Requirements: What Sweden Actually Expects

Sweden publishes **no fixed investment thresholds**.  
Figures like €25,000–€40,000 seen on other websites are inaccurate.

The actual rule:

**You must have enough capital to run your business and support yourself.**

Different businesses require different levels of funding.
