# Is there a shortage of train drivers?  

After several years of a major shortage of train drivers, the acute staffing need now seems to be resolved at **SJ**, **Mälartåg** and **Öresundståg**. But one large company still lacks drivers.

## Summary  
- A few years ago, there was a major shortage of train drivers, caused by canceled training programs and dissatisfaction with schedules.  
- The removal of conductors on Stockholm commuter trains also led many drivers to quit.  
- Transdev and other large railway companies solved the problems, but **Green Cargo** still struggles and many drivers choose to work in **Norway** instead.

## Background  

At the end of 2021, there was a major shortage of train drivers nationwide. The reasons were:  
- The pandemic, which resulted in fewer trained drivers.  
- Widespread dissatisfaction with schedules and the removal of conductors.  

At **SJ**, a new scheduling system led to as many as 30 drivers quitting between January and March 2022.  

Similar dissatisfaction spread to **MTR**, which operated Stockholm commuter trains. Many drivers resigned or called in sick when conductors were removed.

## SJ  

SJ AB reports no shortage of drivers. According to press officer **Johannes Cleris**:  

> “In general, we have good staffing, and our good availability is also due to very low sick leave and low turnover.”  

After the pandemic, demand for travel increased, which created pressure. To manage, SJ launched a new **train driver school** in 2022.

## VR Sverige  

**VR Sverige** operates Pågatågen and Tåg i Bergslagen. No acute shortage is reported, but there is strain in summer.  

> “We mainly experienced a shortage in our Tåg i Bergslagen contract when we needed to recruit 90 new drivers in 2023. We did not meet that goal, so we reduced traffic and used hired drivers,”  
> — **Christer Ekelund, Communications Manager**  

---

## Transdev  

**Transdev** operates Mälartåg, Öresundståg, Östgötapendeln, Roslagsbanan and Snälltåget.  

According to **Stefan Johansson**, press officer:  

> “We recruit continuously to secure future needs. Recruitment is going well with many applicants.”  

The company visits schools and job fairs, and its driving instructors play an important role in attracting new drivers.

## Green Cargo  

Sweden’s largest freight operator still has shortages. Press chief **Stephan Ray**:  

> “We face recruitment difficulties due to higher wages in Norway and freight jobs with lighter duties.”  

Green Cargo recruits via vocational schools and its own **internal training program** launched in 2024. The company pays training costs and works on better schedules and modern workplace culture.

## Hector Rail  

Currently no shortage, says **Natalja Kaganovitch**, communications manager.  

Hector Rail experienced shortages in 2022–2023, but today only recruits to replace departures. The company has focused on social media recruitment campaigns, improved conditions, and digitized processes.

## Tågab  

**Tågab** had a shortage after the pandemic but now reports no acute lack, despite increased traffic.  

> “Tågab seems to have a good reputation among drivers, which attracts them from other companies,”  
> — **Lars Yngström, CEO**  

In August 2024, a new local **train driver program** was launched with Kristinehamn Municipality. The first course was fully booked.

## SJ Stockholmståg  

SJ subsidiary **SJ Stockholmståg** took over Stockholm commuter trains from MTR in March 2024.  

> “There is no longer a shortage of drivers, partly due to training more instructors and improving job satisfaction, work environment and leadership,”  
> — **Stina Petrini, Communications Manager**  

---

## Conclusion  

- Most passenger train operators (SJ, VR, Transdev, Tågab, SJ Stockholmståg) now report no acute shortage.  
- **Green Cargo** remains the exception, struggling to recruit against competition from Norway and facing ongoing challenges.
