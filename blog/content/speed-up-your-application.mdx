## Speed up your citizenship application

If your Swedish citizenship application has been pending more than six months, Section 12 of the Administrative Procedure Act (Förvaltningslagen 2017:900) lets you submit a *begäran om att avgöra ärende* (also called *dröjsmålstalan*). This is a legal mechanism, not a complaint.


### Migrationsverket has to respond
After your request arrives, Migrationsverket has four weeks to either:  
1) decide your case, 
2) issue a separate refusal of your request.  

### You can only file one complaint to Migrationsverket
You can make this request only once per case. If they refuse or miss the four-week deadline, that refusal counts as a formal decision. Under Section 49 of the Administrative Procedure Act, you have the right to appeal it to *förvaltningsrätten* (the administrative court) that would normally handle an appeal of your citizenship case.

## What to write to Migrationsverket

## How to send it

- Via Min sida (recommended): Log in on Migrationsverket’s website and use “Skicka meddelande”.  
- By post:  
  Migrationsverket  
  Medborgarskapsenheten  
  601 70 Norrköping  

Note: Fax or general e-mail is not valid for a Section 12 request. The four-week countdown starts the day Migrationsverket receives your request.

## What Happens Next

Once your request is submitted, the Migration Agency must respond within four weeks. They can either decide your case or issue a refusal to decide. That refusal is an official decision you can appeal to the Migration Court.

This first step is how you turn silence into action and make sure the agency cannot ignore your application indefinitely.
