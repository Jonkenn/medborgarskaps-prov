### Residency Requirement Increased to 8 Years  
Applicants must live in Sweden for at least **eight years** before applying for citizenship. This is a stricter rule compared to the current system, where five years is often enough.

### Mandatory Swedish Language Test  
A compulsory **Swedish language test** will prove that applicants can speak and understand the national language, strengthening integration and participation in society.

### Civics Knowledge Test  
Applicants must also pass a **civics knowledge test** covering democracy, laws, and Swedish society. This follows a model similar to other EU countries.



### No Criminal Record Requirement  
A clean **criminal record** will be necessary. Anyone convicted of crimes in Sweden will be disqualified from applying.

### Financial Self-Sufficiency  
For the first time, Sweden will demand **financial independence**. Applicants must show they can support themselves without relying on state aid.

## Why Swedish Citizenship Requirements Are Being Tightened

The government argues that the current rules are outdated. Sweden has long had some of the most lenient naturalization rules in Europe. By implementing these **new requirements 2026**, officials aim to ensure that citizenship reflects both rights and responsibilities.  

Supporters believe that higher standards will increase public confidence in migration policy and encourage stronger integration. Critics, however, argue that stricter **Swedish citizenship requirements** could exclude residents who already contribute but may struggle with exams or financial proof.

## Historical Background: Citizenship Reforms in Sweden

It has been more than **50 years** since Sweden last implemented such a comprehensive citizenship reform. Over that time, the number of immigrants and naturalized citizens has grown dramatically. Forssell argues that the **new requirements 2026** are necessary to safeguard the meaning and integrity of Swedish citizenship in today’s society.
