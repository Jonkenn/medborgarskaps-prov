# Återvandringsbidrag 2026: New Rules, Higher Amounts and How to Qualify

Sweden will introduce completely new rules for the **återvandringsbidrag** on **1 January 2026**. The reform is extensive: the amounts increase dramatically, eligibility is more strictly defined, and the payment model changes in a way designed to encourage long-term, permanent return.  

If you are living in Sweden with a protection-based residence permit, or if you support someone who is, it is important to understand exactly what the 2026 rules mean. This guide explains the new återvandringsbidrag clearly and in plain English, with a full breakdown of how much money is available and who can apply.

## Overview: What the återvandringsbidrag is in 2026

The återvandringsbidrag is financial support from **Migrationsverket** for people who choose to **voluntarily** leave Sweden. It applies to individuals who originally received residence permits on protection grounds and who now want to return to their home country — or move to another country where they already have the right to live.

From 2026, the goal of the reform is to make voluntary return more financially viable, while preventing short-term returns to Sweden.

## New 2026 payment amounts

One of the biggest questions people search for is *“hur mycket pengar kan man få i återvandringsbidrag 2026?”*  
Here are the official amounts:

- **350,000 SEK per adult (18+)**  
- **25,000 SEK per child**  
- **Maximum 500,000 SEK** for couples (married or cohabiting)  
- **Maximum 600,000 SEK** per household  

This makes the återvandringsbidrag 2026 the highest voluntary return support Sweden has ever offered.

## Who can apply for the återvandringsbidrag in 2026?

To qualify under the new rules, you must:

1. Live in Sweden  
2. Have received your residence permit **on or before 12 September 2024**  
3. Have one of the following types of permits:

   - Refugee status  
   - Subsidiary protection (alternativt skyddsbehövande)  
   - Quota refugee  
   - Residence permit based on particularly distressing circumstances  
   - Permanent residence permit under *gymnasielagen*  
   - Permanent residence permit under the temporary asylum law (2016–2021)  

These criteria are precise. If your permit was issued after 12 September 2024, you do **not** qualify for the 2026 återvandringsbidrag.

## Rules for family members

Family members may also receive the återvandringsbidrag if:

- Their residence permit is based on **family ties** to the main applicant  
- They received their permit on or before 12 September 2024  
- They live in the same household  

Not all family members need to leave Sweden at the same time. Their share of the grant is paid when *they* leave.

---

## Who is excluded under the 2026 rules?

You **cannot** receive the återvandringsbidrag if you:

- Are a Swedish citizen  
- Have previously received återvandringsbidrag  
- Plan to move to an **EU/EES country or Switzerland**  
- Are from Ukraine and hold a permit under the mass-flight directive  
- Have unpaid debts with **CSN** or **Kronofogden**  
- Are convicted, prosecuted or suspected of certain crimes  

These exclusions are strict and are central to the new 2026 framework.

## How the 2026 återvandringsbidrag is paid out

The new rules introduce a staged payment model. The money is not paid at once. Instead, you receive the grant in three parts:

### 1. **20%** — paid in Sweden  
Paid after Migrationsverket approves your application.

### 2. **40%** — paid when you arrive in the country you move to  

### 3. **60%** — paid **earliest 15 months** after leaving Sweden  
This final part is paid only if your Swedish residence permit is no longer valid.

This schedule is intended to support long-term resettlement outside Sweden.

---

## When you must pay the money back

Another common search topic is *“måste man betala tillbaka återvandringsbidraget?”*  
Under the 2026 rules, you must repay the money if you:

- Do not leave Sweden within **12 months** of receiving your decision  
- Move back to Sweden after taking any part of the grant  
- Provided incorrect information in your application  

The repayment requirements are strict and non-negotiable.

---

## What happens to your residence permit?

When you leave Sweden permanently, Migrationsverket may **revoke your residence permit**.

- If you want to **keep your residence permit**, you must notify Migrationsverket before leaving.  
- Temporary residence permits expire normally when they reach the end of their validity.  

### Can you return to Sweden later?
Yes — but only if your residence permit is still valid.  
If you return after receiving the återvandringsbidrag, you must **repay the full amount**.

---

## Summary

The återvandringsbidrag 2026 is a major reform with significantly higher payments and stricter conditions. To qualify, you must have a protection-related residence permit issued on or before 12 September 2024. The grant can amount to up to **600,000 SEK per household**, and payments are distributed in three steps over more than a year.

For anyone considering voluntary return, these new rules make 2026 the most substantial policy change in years.
