## How to file a complaint to Migrationsverket

In [Step 2](/blog/citizenship-speedup-step2), you saw how the four-week rule forces Migrationsverket to act.  
But if they still fail to comply, you can escalate outside the agency.  

Two independent oversight bodies supervise all Swedish authorities:

1. **Parliamentary Ombudsman (Justitieombudsmannen, JO)** — investigates complaints about unlawful delays or misconduct.  
2. **Chancellor of Justice (Justitiekanslern, JK)** — handles claims for damages when the state violates rights, including unreasonable delays.  

Migrationsverket, as a government authority, is subject to both JO and JK. In short: JO can criticise them publicly, JK can order the state to pay you compensation.

### How to File a JO Complaint

1. Go to [jo.se](https://www.jo.se).  
2. Use the online complaint form (*Gör en anmälan*).  
3. State your **case number**, **dates**, and describe the delay clearly.  
4. Attach proof (copy of your Section 12 request, submission receipts, and any reply you received).  

Here is a template you can adapt for JO:

```text
To the Parliamentary Ombudsman (JO)

Subject: Citizenship application at the Migration Agency (Migrationsverket)  
Case number: [insert case number]  
Name: [insert full name]  
Personal identity number: [insert Swedish personal number, if applicable]  

I submitted my application for Swedish citizenship on [date].  
More than six months have passed, and despite also filing a request for determination under Section 12 of the Administrative Procedure Act (2017:900),  
the Migration Agency has still not made a decision.  

I consider this delay to violate the requirement of handling cases without undue delay under the Administrative Procedure Act.  
I therefore request that JO investigate the Migration Agency’s handling of my case.  

Date: [date]  
Signature: [name]  
```

### How to File a JK Claim

1. Go to [jk.se](https://www.jk.se).  
2. Use the application form for damages (*Skadeståndsanspråk mot staten*).  
3. Include:  
   - Your citizenship case number  
   - Your Section 12 request and proof of submission  
   - Evidence of how the delay harmed you (financial loss, stress, legal consequences)  
4. Send the claim by post or e-mail as instructed on JK’s website.  

Here is a template you can adapt for JK:

```text
To the Chancellor of Justice (Justitiekanslern, JK)

Subject: Claim for damages — unreasonable delay by the Migration Agency  
Case number: [insert case number]  
Name: [insert full name]  
Personal identity number: [insert Swedish personal number, if applicable]  

I submitted my application for Swedish citizenship on [date].  
The Migration Agency has still not made a decision, even though more than six months have passed and I have also filed a request for determination under Section 12 of the Administrative Procedure Act (2017:900).  

This delay has caused me [financial loss / non-financial harm such as anxiety and stress].  
I therefore request compensation under Chapter 3, Section 2 of the Tort Liability Act (1972:207) and Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (right to a decision within a reasonable time).  

Date: [date]  
Signature: [name]

## Why filing a complaint to Migrationsverket matters

- **JO** creates public accountability by criticising unlawful or unreasonable delays.  
- **JK** creates financial consequences for the state through compensation.  

Neither JO nor JK can order the Migration Agency to decide your case, but both increase the legal and political cost of inaction and strengthen your position.

## Practical Tips

- Always keep copies of everything you send.  
- Be specific: write dates, case number, and how long you have waited.  
- Use clear and factual language — the oversight bodies need facts, not emotions.
